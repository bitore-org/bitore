# BitOre: Advanced Proof-of-Work Mining Protocol

BitOre is an innovative blockchain mining project that implements a sophisticated Proof-of-Work (PoW) system. It introduces a dynamic, epoch-based mining mechanism with adaptive difficulty and a unique reward system based on miners' historical gas usage. This project aims to create a more efficient and fair mining environment while maintaining network security.

### BitOre protocol for accepting PoW solutions in 3rd party contracts:
```
interface IBitOreProtocol {
    function mintEpoch(address to, uint256 epoch, bytes32 nonce, uint256 epochMinersLimit) external;

    function mintChip(address to, uint256 epoch, bytes32 nonce, uint256 position, uint256 epochBlock, uint256 epochMinersLimit) external;
}
```

## Features

- Epoch-based mining system with adaptive length
- Dynamic difficulty adjustment for optimal mining pace
- Gas-usage based mining rewards to incentivize efficiency
- Multiple token minting support for flexible reward structures
- Reentrancy protection for enhanced security
- Automatic adjustment of allowed miners per epoch
- Gaussian distribution target for balanced network participation

## Smart Contracts

The core of this project is the `BitOrePow.sol` contract, which manages the entire mining process. It interacts with an `IBitOreToken` interface for minting rewards.

### Key Components

- **Epoch System**: Mining occurs in epochs, targeting 60 seconds length but adjustable based on network conditions.
- **Dynamic Difficulty**: The mining difficulty (`miningTarget`) adjusts based on network participation and mining speed.
- **Miner Allowance**: The contract dynamically adjusts the number of allowed miners per epoch to balance participation.
- **Gas-Based Rewards**: A unique feature where miners' rewards are influenced by their historical gas usage, promoting efficient mining practices.
- **Multi-Token Minting**: Supports minting multiple token types as rewards for successful miners.

## Technical Details

### Epoch Management

- Epochs start and end based on block numbers
- New epochs trigger difficulty adjustments and miner allowance updates

### Difficulty Adjustment

- Difficulty increases if 68.2% of allowed miners participate in less than half the epoch time
- Adjustments aim to maintain optimal epoch length and network security

### Reward Calculation

- Miners' rewards are multiplied based on their historical gas usage
- A base multiplier is adjusted up to a maximum multiplier to reward efficient miners

### Security Measures

- Reentrancy guard to prevent exploits
- Checks to ensure miners only participate once per epoch

## Getting Started

To set up the BitOre project:

Install dependencies:

```
npm install
```

Compile the contracts:

```
npm compile
```

Run tests:

```
npm test
```

## Usage

Miners can participate by calling the `mine` function:

```
function mine(bytes32 nonce, address[] calldata mintAddresses) public nonReentrant
```

- `nonce`: A unique value to solve the mining puzzle
- `mintAddresses`: Array of token addresses to mint as rewards

## Configuration

Key configurable parameters:

- `epochLengthOptimal`: Target epoch length (default: 60 seconds)
- `adjustmentInterval`: Frequency of major adjustments (default: every 4 epochs)
- `allowedMiners`: Maximum number of miners per epoch (dynamically adjusted)
- `miningTarget`: Current mining difficulty target
- `baseMultiplier` and `maxMultiplier`: Control the range of reward multipliers
